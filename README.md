# Neighborhood Map - Project 7 - The Last One :(
---
 develop a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.
 You will then add additional functionality to this application,
 including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit,
 a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations.
 You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
